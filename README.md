# Elite Joystick Project
A 3d-printed replica of the joystick, throttle and panels seen in Elite Dangerous.

The repository will keep track of the 3d original designs (made using Modo, usually in .LXO format), exported print-ready STL files, Gerber and Eagle circuitboard designs, assocaited content and docs for my 3d-printed replica of the in-game joystick, throttle and information panels seen in Elite Dangerous.

The Gimbal of this stick design is a modified version of the amazing work done by Jake over at RealRobots. This wouldn't have been possible without his work and help so plase support his site, take a look at his stuff and if you can, contribute to his Patreon.
