A 3d-printed replica of the joystick, throttle and panels seen in Elite Dangerous.

The repository will keep track of the 3d original designs (made using Modo, usually in .LXO format), exported print-ready STL files, Gerber and Eagle circuitboard designs, assocaited content and docs for my 3d-printed replica of the in-game joystick, thorttle and information panels seen in Elite Dangerous.
