# Elite Joystick Project
A 3d-printed replica of the joystick, throttle and panels seen in Elite Dangerous.

Updated Sept 2022:

The joystick is nearing it's final form. All printable files are versioned, with the last version file being the up-to-date print. Previous prints are kept for reference/re-design/I'm too lazy to sort it out yet.

EAGLE files are in as well - these relate to teh custom PCB's needed for the stick. So far, there's a custom PCB in the gimbal housing for all the wries comign from the stick & gimbal to go to the arduino pro micro, there's a Expander IO inside the stick (MCP23017) for most of the internal buttons, and there's 2 custom PCBs for the top of the stick, one for the vertical buttons and a second for the horizontal button & HAT switch.

I haven't fone a full BoM yet but I have notes top do so when I'm finished with the stick.

I'm now working on the button box (right panel box) and the palm rest (left panel box) which has various prints in teh repo now...these are stalled due to not being able to source the RPI Zero I need...

The repository will keep track of the 3d original designs (made using Modo, usually in .LXO format), exported print-ready STL files, Gerber and Eagle circuitboard designs, assocaited content and docs for my 3d-printed replica of the in-game joystick, throttle and information panels seen in Elite Dangerous.

The Gimbal of this stick design is a modified version of the amazing work done by Jake over at RealRobots. This wouldn't have been possible without his work and help so plase support his site, take a look at his stuff and if you can, contribute to his Patreon (I'm not affiliated with him in any way, he's just a good guy and has been a lot of help!)
